## Procedurally generated PDF figures for Computer Graphics courses


This repository contains C++ source code which is used to generate **LaTex** source, which, in turn is compiled onto PDF files. 
The latex source uses **Tikz** latex package. To create the PDFs, enter _pdfs_ folder and type `make all`. It requires an updated installation of 
**texlive** or other package providing `pdflatex` command. To compile C++ code, `clang++` (or `gcc++`) command is required.
A PNG version for each PDF can be generated by using `make` on _pngs_ folder (it requires `pdftoppm` command from **poppler** package).

Current figures are these:

<h2>Figure 9</h2>

The scene from fig.8 is shown projected onto the clip coordinates space, after using a perspective projection projection matrix.

</div>
	

<h2>Figure 8</h2>

A scene is shown inside the perspective view frustum, aligned with the camera reference frame.

</div>


<h2>Figure 7</h2>

A cuboid (or orthoedron) is shown, it is the visible region when an orthographic projection is used. 
As in fig 5, the coordinates of the cuboid vertexes are shown, in terms of l,r,b,t,n and f.

<div align="center">
    <img src="pngs/fig07-cuboid1.png" width="400px"</img> 
</div>


<h2>Figure 6</h2>

The perspective view-frustum is shown, but here the hfovy angle (beta) is emphasized. It is also shown how to 
compute l,r,b and t parameters from beta and n,f,a (aspect ratio). This is usefull to understand the parameters 
for `gluPerspective` function. 

<div align="center">

</div>

<h2>Figure 5</h2>

The perspective view-frustum is shown, along with the coordinates of its vertexes, in terms of l,r,b,t,n and f. 
These coordinates are relative to the camera reference system.

<h2>Figure 4</h2>

This figure shows how a vector (_s_) is rotated an angle (_beta_) around a unit-length axis vector (_e_). 
The rotated vector (_t_) is a linear combination of the three vectors (_u_,_v_ and _w_) in the reference frame 
introduced in previous figure 3.

</div>


<h2>Figure 3</h2>

In order to define rotation in 3D, it is neccesary to compute an orthogonal reference frame (_u_,_v_,_w_,_o_) which is 
aligned with the original vector _s_ and axis _e_. This can be donde by using dot and cross products, but
it is also possible to obtain the frame by just using the _P_ operator, as shown.

</div>


<h2>Figure 2</h2>

The rotation in 2D is defined by using a combination of the original vector _u_ and its perpendicular vector _v_. This combination 
uses the _sin_ and _cos_ functions, as shown.

<div align="center">

</div>


<h2>Figure 1</h2>

In order to define the rotation in 2D, we can introduce the operator _P_, which outputs a perpendicular vector to another given vector. 
This can be easily done by using the coordinates of the original in a Cartesian coordinate system, as it is shown here.
